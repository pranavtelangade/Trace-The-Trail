# Trace-The-Trail
Project for final year of Batchelor of Computer Engineering

Missing cases have been increasing day by day and the process of investigating and finding the lost person consumes a lot of time. Single Stage Detectors speed up the process of matching the lost person's image to their last presence (face) extracted from the CCTV footages. Feature extraction procedure can be carried out and optimized by deep learning models with little to no manual work. Any data (video, pictures) can be fed into a deep learning model, which uses the architecture provided to process the data and execute data extraction to train itself and learn about the numerous data elements affecting the prediction or output. By feeding the data into the model and obtaining the output, the model can be used to forecast unknown data after successfully undergoing training. After skimming through the previous research, its many shortcomings were exposed. In India, still manual search and investigation is used in a lot of places. Face recognition resolves the problem of tedious search process. The research proposes a system that would accelerate the process of finding missing people and aid the search by matching the photo uploaded to the individual's face extracted from the CCTV footages.
