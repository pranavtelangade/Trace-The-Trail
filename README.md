# Trace-The-Trail
Project for final year of Batchelor of Computer Engineering

Trace The Trail is an innovative Face Recognition approach to find missing humans using Deep Learning Tech “YOLO” (You Only Look Once). The research proposes a system that would accelerate the process of finding missing people and aid the search by matching the photo uploaded to the individual’s face. The prime objective of building such a system is to track the missing people in a very short period.
